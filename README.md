keyboard control with eyes
I helped my friend's project and  we coded together. After than we loaded to Raspberry and used with camera.
 You can control the keyboard with using your eyes and blinking. I coded on PyCharm the last version. If you can't run,please make sure all required plugins are installed.
Every one step works different.Step by step the program updated.
